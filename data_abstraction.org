Data abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.

We wish to structure our programs such that they use compound data objects that operate on "abstract data". Programs should use data in such a way as to make -no- assumptions about the data that is not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand.
